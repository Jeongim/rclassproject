# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results

##Plot 1

```{r plot 1}
summary_plot <- data %>%
  group_by(age_group, condition)%>%
  summarize(average_trust = mean(total_trust))
  
ggplot(summary_plot, aes(age_group, average_trust))+
  geom_col(aes(fill=condition), position= "dodge", alpha=.7)+
    labs(title= "Children's Selective Trust of Helpful over Tricky informant" , 
       subtitle = " Separated by Condition and Age group ", 
       x = "Age Group", y = "Average Trust Score")+
  theme_minimal()

```

##Plot 2

```{r plot2}

summary_plot2 <- data_tidy %>% 
  group_by(subid)%>%
  summarize(average_csus = mean(csus_response), average_trust = mean(total_trust))%>%
  filter(!is.na(average_csus))

ggplot(summary_plot2, aes(average_trust, average_csus))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method= "lm")+
  labs(title= "Relation between CSUS Response and Children's Trust Score" , 
       subtitle = " CSUS response is parents' response on Children's Theory of Mind", 
       x = "Average Trust Score", y = "Average CSUS Response")+
  theme_minimal()
